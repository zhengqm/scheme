# A scheme implementation in haskell

This repo is a toy implemenation of scheme following the [Write Yourself a Scheme in 48 Hours](https://en.wikibooks.org/wiki/Write_Yourself_a_Scheme_in_48_Hours) tutorial.

Several modifications are made compared to the original tutorial:

+ Stack building tools are used to setup the environment and build the project.
+ `ExceptT` is used to replace the deprecated `ErrorT`
+ ...
